## 📊 Architecture Quality Metrics

### ✅ Layer Separation

```
API Layer        → ✅ Only imports services, not repositories
Service Layer    → ✅ Only imports repositories and base classes
Repository Layer → ✅ Only contains data access logic
Base Layer       → ✅ Provides common utilities and patterns
```

### ✅ Dependency Direction

```
API → Middleware → Service → Repository → Database
✅ No circular dependencies
✅ No layer skipping
✅ Proper dependency injection patterns
```

### ✅ Error Handling Flow

```
Database Error → Repository (log + rethrow)
Repository Error → Service (convert to ServiceError)
Service Error → Middleware (convert to HTTP response)
HTTP Response → Client (standardized format)
```

### ✅ Permission Checking

```
API Middleware → Basic authentication
Service Layer  → Resource-specific permissions
Repository     → Data access validation (no business logic)
```

## 🎯 Architecture Patterns Successfully Implemented

### 1. ✅ Repository Pattern

- Abstract base repository with common operations
- Entity-specific repositories with custom methods
- Proper separation of data access from business logic
- Efficient query implementations with relationships

### 2. ✅ Service Layer Pattern

- Business logic centralization
- Permission checking integration
- Cross-entity operation orchestration
- Transaction boundary management

### 3. ✅ Middleware Pattern

- Authentication and authorization
- Request/response transformation
- Error handling and logging
- Rate limiting and security

### 4. ✅ RBAC Pattern

- Role-based permission checking
- Resource-specific authorization
- Customer data isolation
- Staff/customer access separation
